# Confidential_transactions

## Abstract

The study of private digital transactions can be traced back to the 1980s [1]. In the context of Bitcoin, Adam Back proposed that Bitcoin and related systems could use additive homomorphic commitments instead of explicit amounts in place of values in transactions for improved privacy in 2013. This approach makes transaction amounts privateâ€“known only to the sender, the receiver, and whichever parties they choose to share the information with through sharing watching keys or through revealing single transactions. Most of the contents of this article is from an overview of CT (confidential transactions) by Maxwell [2], while some concrete examples and related were also provided.
